                <p>Significant measures are taken by our team to protect your privacy. All data is coded, encrypted, and de-identified. All personal account information (name, email, contact info.) is separated from the health data. Only key members of the study team will have the key to associate your coded study data to your name and account information.</p>

                <p>Despite these precautions, there is always a very small risk to loss of privacy. The risk to privacy and confidentiality should be considered before participating in the study.</p>
