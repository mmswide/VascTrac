        <p>Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is the narrowing of arteries that donâ€™t supply the brain or the heart. In the United States, PAD affects 12 - 20% of Americans age 65 and older. Approximately 10 million Americans have PAD.</p>
        
        <p>Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, heart disease, high blood pressure, and age over 65. PAD is caused by atherosclerosis (buildup of plaque/cholesterol) in the arteries over a long period of time.</p>
        
        <p>PAD most commonly affects the legs, but other arteries may be involved. The classic symptom is leg pain during walking that resolves with rest, also known as intermittent claudication. Other symptoms include poor nail and hair growth in the affected leg, as well as skin ulcers and gangrene in advanced cases.</p>
