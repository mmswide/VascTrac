				<p>Every two weeks, we will ask you walk for six minutes to monitor how far you can walk without stopping. The walking test will ask you to walk at your normal pace, stopping as your normally would if you develop symptoms (leg cramps, aches, or pains).</p>
                
				<p>Every three months, we will ask you to answer a short medical survey about symptoms you may be experiencing or vascular procedures you may have had recently.</p>

				<p>Total monthly time commitment should be no more than 20 minutes.</p>
