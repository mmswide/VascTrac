    <strong>TITLE:</strong>
    <strong>VascTrac PAD ResearchKit Study</strong>    
</p>
<br />

<p><strong>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH</strong></p>
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study of activity in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We hope to learn how activity changes over time in people with peripheral arterial disease and also how our interventions affect your activity. If are eligible for this study if you have PAD. This study is being done together by researchers at VA Palo Alto and Stanford University. Individual health information will be de-identified to all researchers, and will be stored as anonymized data in the databases. However, individuals may choose to send their identifiable data to their personal physicians to receive personalized care. Health information will be used to identify trends between physical fitness and participant demographics and PAD.</p>
<p>This research study is looking for 5000 people with PAD in the United States.</p>
<br/>


<p><strong>VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION</strong></p>
<p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. Your decision not to participate will not have any negative effect on you or your medical care. You can decide to participate now, but withdraw your consent later and stop being in the study without any loss of benefits or medical care you are entitled to.</p>
<br />


<p><strong>DURATION OF STUDY INVOLVEMENT</strong></p>
<p>This research study is expected to take approximately 2 years. The mobile registration process requires an eligibility questionnaire and is followed by a brief medical and surgical history. Your daily activity will be monitored passively (without any further input from you) through your mobile phone. Every quarter we will send a questionnaire to ask if you have had any vascular surgical interventions or other health issues. Your active participation answering surveys will be likely only 9 days.</p>
<br />


<p><strong>PROCEDURES</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to participate, the investigators will not require any procedures to be performed. The investigators will monitor your activity using the activity tracker of your mobile phone and will send out a questionnaire on your mobile phone upon registering as well as on a quarterly basis.</p>
<br />
