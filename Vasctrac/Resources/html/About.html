                    <p>VascTrac is a study that examines how physical activity relates to peripheral artery disease (PAD). This Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved study is 100% performed through your iPhone and was developed using Appleâ€™s ResearchKit software.</p>

                    <p>By using smartphones, we can monitor patient activity more frequently and over longer periods of time than ever before. We are particularly interested in seeing how vascular procedures (open bypass surgery or endovascular procedures) affect daily activity with the hope that this data will one day improve treatments for PAD patients.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Oliver Aalami, Clinical Associate Professor of Surgery at Stanford University, is the principle investigator for this study. He can be contacted at: <a href="mailto:aalami@stanford.edu?Subject=VascTrac%20questions" target="_top">aalami@stanford.edu</a> with any concerns or questions.</P>
