                    <p>Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) can manifest in many ways depending on how advanced the blockages in the arteries are. Many patients (70 - 80%) with mild disease do not have any symptoms.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once the blockages become more significant, patients report leg muscle cramping, pain, or fatigue when walking or climbing stairs. This discomfort consistently occurs with physical activity and always resolves with rest.</p>
                    
                    <p>Those affected by PAD often have poor hair and nail growth in the affected limb. More advanced symptoms include non-healing wounds/ulcers and pain at rest.</p>
