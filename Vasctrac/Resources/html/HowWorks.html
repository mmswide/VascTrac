        <p>With your consent, you will be asked to allow the VascTrac app to collect activity data from your iPhone, specifically the total steps you walked in a day, the distance you walked, and the number of flights of stairs you climbed.</p>
       
        <p>Every 3 months you will be asked to answer a survey about your symptoms as well as any recent vascular surgery procedures.</p>
       
        <p>You will also be asked to perform a “Walk Test” every two weeks. The Walk Test monitors how far you can walk without stopping for a maximum of 15 minutes. Patients with moderate to severe peripheral artery disease will often develop calf cramping (claudication) with walking, so the Walk Test lets us monitor these symptoms as well.</p>
       
        <p>The VascTrac app also provides educational links to learn more about any of your data. You may also be asked to try different ways to help you improve your activity and vascular health.</p>
