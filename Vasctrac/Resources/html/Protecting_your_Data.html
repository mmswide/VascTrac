                <p>When you register for VascTrac, your study data is always encrypted, including while on your phone, during transmission to our servers,
                    and while stored in our databases.</p>
                
                <p>We de-identify your data to keep your enrollment confidential. This involves replacing your account information with a random code in all of your study data (your responses to the surveys and your activity data). Any information that could be used to identify you (name, email, contact info, etc.) will always be stored separately from your study data. Only key personnel from the study team can connect the random code to your account information.</p>
