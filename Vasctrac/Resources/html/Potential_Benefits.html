				<p>This study examines how physical activity relates to peripheral artery disease (PAD). By using smartphones, we can monitor patient activity more frequently and over longer periods of time than ever before.</p>

                <p>We hope to better understand how PAD develops and worsens, as well as how surgical and medical interventions affect your daily life. This could lead to better treatments for patients in the future.</p>

                <p>This study is NOT a medical diagnostic tool and is not designed to provide medical advice, professional diagnosis, opinion, treatment, or healthcare services.</p>

                <p>You should not use information provided in VascTrac or the study documentation in place of care from your physician or health care provider. If you have any questions or concerns related to your health, you should seek advice of a medical professional.</p>
